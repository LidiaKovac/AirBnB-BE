## Notes: 

-This was my first project using flex-grid! I was really used to just *position: absolute* everything and then write several media queries, \ 
but I am now free of all nighters trying to make a website reponsive.\
-Wherever you see "NaN" in the screenshots I still need to put a conditional render on the ratings. \
-The AddHouse component is made-up based on AirBnB color scheme.
